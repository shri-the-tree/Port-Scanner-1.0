# Port-Scanner-1.0

In computer networking, ports are virtual endpoints for communication. They allow different applications on a computer to communicate with other devices over a network. Ports are numbered from 1 to 65535, with certain port numbers reserved for specific services.

This Python Port Scanner project efficiently identifies open ports on specified target systems. It provides a vital tool for network security assessments, allowing users to assess potential vulnerabilities and enhance overall system security.
